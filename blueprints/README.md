# Save Blueprints Here

The [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/) file format uses relative
directories to keep track of the images in your maps and blueprints.  That means
that if you move the tiles, or if you move your map files, the map files will
break.

Save your maps and blueprints in this directory, or it's sub-directories, to
make sure they keep working.
