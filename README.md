# Minetest Textures as TileD Tilesets

Trying to plan good Minetest builds with normal image editors got on my *nerves*
because they aren't really set up with the expectation that a 20 x 20 grid is
pretty big.  Pencil and graph-paper worked alright for mazes *(flash back to the
1980s, whee!)*, but there's this thing called color you may have heard of...

Wait, am I being snarky again?

Whatever.

I took some relevant Minetest mod textures and loaded them into the
[TileD](http://www.mapeditor.org/) map editor.  Now you (well, *I*, but I guess
you too) can pre-plan builds using actual textures from the game.  It's wayyy
easier than messing around with individual pixels. You can actually get a
pretty decent idea of whether your plan is going to look right before you waste
an afternoon pretending to do hard labor.

I hope this will inspire some of you plebs to build something besides *yet
another* half-roofed cobblestone cube to "live" in. Or at least put in some
windows, wth.

I'm *kidding.*  Really.

# How to use

1. Download this repository.  If you don't know where you want it, *Your
Documents/minetest* will have to do. 
2. Install the [TileD](http://www.mapeditor.org/) map editor.
    - Yes, *it's Free Software* and yes, it's available for Windows / Mac /
      Linux.
3. Open a new file in TileD, and click **Map -> Add External Tileset.**  Open
**minetest.tsx**
    - You should see the little blocks that look just like the ones in Minetest
      that you can now draw with. **Yay!**
4. Draw your blueprint.
5. It'd be a good idea to save your blueprint in the **blueprint** directory,
which is right next to that **minetest.tsx** file you just opened.

I hope this helps.  Now **put the cobblestone down.**
