# Minetest Textures as TileD Tilesets

Trying to plan good Minetest builds with normal image editors got on my nerves.
Tiny, icon-sized pixel-art isn't great for describing imaginary life-sized
buildings.  Pencil and graph-paper worked alright for mazes, but... *flash back
to the 1980s!*

Wait, am I being snarky again?

Luckily, the Minetest game textures are easily accessible, and the Free [TileD
map editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/) works really well for laying out
blueprints.

**This is a tile-set of the most essential Minetest nodes.**

Now you (well, it's for me, but you can use it) can pre-plan builds using
textures from the game.  It's *way* easier than messing around with individual
pixels.  Use it to test different layouts and materials ahead of time, so you
don't waste an evening building something you hate.

# How to use

1. Download this repository.  If you don't know where you want it: **Your
   Documents/minetest**
2. Install the [TileD](http://www.mapeditor.org/) map editor.
    - Yes, *it's Free Software* and yes, it's available for Windows / Mac /
      Linux.
3. Open a new file in TileD, and click **Map -> Add External Tileset.**  Open
**minetest_game.tsx**
    - You should see the little blocks that look just like the ones in Minetest
      that you can now draw with. *Yay!*
4. Draw your blueprint.
5. It'd be a good idea to save your blueprint in the **blueprint** directory,
   which is right next to that **minetest_game.tsx** file you just opened.

I hope this helps.  Now please, *put the cobblestone down.*
